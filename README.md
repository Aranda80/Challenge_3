The purpose of this application is to analyse the potential arbitrage opportunities in cryptocurrencies arising from simultaneous price dislocations between Bitstamp and Coinbase markets using historical data from Jan 01, 2018 to Mar 31, 2018. 

In the analysis, we looked at three dates within the period and calculated the potential arbitrage profits on such dates. 

The conclusion is that on such period, early on the data set, there seems to be an increasing arbitrage opportunity, however, already by Mar 1, the opportunity for profitable arbitrage had disappeared, which is confirmed by the data from Mar 30. There were no instances where the return were over the required 1% to cover at least the transactional costs.
